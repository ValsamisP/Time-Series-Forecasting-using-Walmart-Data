##  Project Overview

This project is part of the **Workshop I - Supply Chain** course in the Master in Data Science program at the University of Luxembourg. The objective is to gain hands-on experience in dealing with, modeling, forecasting, and solving real-world complex time series problems using Walmart sales data from a historical Kaggle competition.

### Goals

-  **Practical Experience**: Apply time series forecasting techniques to real retail data
-  **Method Comparison**: Evaluate different forecasting approaches systematically
-  **Business Impact**: Understand implications for inventory management and supply chain optimization
-  **Statistical Rigor**: Implement and validate forecasting models with proper metrics

### Key Questions Addressed

1. **Part 1**: Which forecasting approach is more accurate - aggregating first then disaggregating, or forecasting directly at the granular level?
2. **Part 2**: How can we maximize forecast accuracy to optimize rebate opportunities in supplier contracts? *(Coming Soon)*

##  Part 1: Forecasting Methods Comparison

### Overview

Part 1 compares two fundamental forecasting approaches in time series analysis:

- **Method 1 (Direct Forecasting)**: Forecast sales directly at the department level
- **Method 2 (Aggregate-Disaggregate)**: Aggregate sales to store level, forecast, then disaggregate back to departments

### Hypothesis

We hypothesize that **Method 1** would outperform **Method 2** because:
- It captures department-specific patterns
- Avoids loss of granular information through aggregation
- Can model unique seasonal behaviors per department

### Key Findings

**Surprising Result:** Method 2 (Aggregate-Disaggregate) outperformed Method 1 by **3.96% RMSE improvement** for Store 1, Department 1.

**Why?**
1. **Noise Reduction**: Aggregation smoothed out volatile department-level fluctuations
2. **Stable Proportions**: Department 1 maintained consistent sales proportions
3. **Stronger Signal**: Store-level seasonality was clearer and more predictable

### Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handle negative sales values
   - Train-test split (last 4 weeks as test set)
   - Check for missing values

2. **Trend Analysis**
   - Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test
   - KPSS test for trend stationarity
   - Mann-Kendall trend test
   - Linear regression slope analysis

3. **Modeling**
   - Holt-Winters Seasonal Exponential Smoothing (No Trend)
   - Grid search for optimal parameters (α, γ)
   - Both additive and multiplicative seasonality tested

4. **Evaluation Metrics**
   - **TSE (Total Squared Error)**: Overall model fit
   - **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**: Standard forecasting metric
   - **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**: Robust error measure

### Access Part 1

**Quarto Document:**
```bash
cd myquarto
quarto preview Part1.qmd
```

**Jupyter Notebook:**
```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/Part1_Comparing_HigherLevel_UnitLevel.ipynb
```

##  Part 2: Coming Soon

Part 2 will focus on **maximizing forecast accuracy** to optimize rebate opportunities in supplier contracts. Stay tuned!

**Expected Topics:**
- Advanced forecasting models (ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM)
- Incorporating external variables (holidays, promotions, economic indicators)
- Multi-step ahead forecasting
- Probabilistic forecasting and uncertainty quantification
- Business optimization and decision-making framework

##  Data Description

### Source

Walmart Store Sales Forecasting - [Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/walmart-recruiting-store-sales-forecasting)

### Files

| File | Description | Size |
|------|-------------|------|
| `train.csv` | Historical weekly sales data | 421,570 rows |
| `test.csv` | Test set for predictions | 115,064 rows |
| `features.csv` | Store, department, regional info | Multiple tables |
| `stores.csv` | Store type and size metadata | 45 stores |

**Note:** Only `train.csv` is used for Part 1 analysis.

### Key Variables Used

- **Store**: Store number (1-45)
- **Dept**: Department number (1-99)
- **Date**: Week ending date (2010-2012)
- **Weekly_Sales**: Sales for the department in the given week


## 🔬 Methodology

### Statistical Framework

Our analysis follows a rigorous statistical approach:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualize time series patterns
   - Identify seasonality, trend, and outliers
   - Check for stationarity

2. **Model Selection**
   - Test for trend presence (multiple statistical tests)
   - Choose appropriate model (Holt-Winters, ARIMA, etc.)
   - Consider additive vs. multiplicative seasonality

3. **Parameter Optimization**
   - Grid search for hyperparameters
   - Minimize in-sample error (TSE)
   - Validate on hold-out test set

4. **Evaluation & Comparison**
   - Multiple metrics (TSE, RMSE, MAE)
   - Visualize forecasts vs. actuals
   - Statistical significance testing

### Models Implemented

#### Holt-Winters Seasonal Exponential Smoothing

**Additive Model:**
```
Level: L_t = α(Y_t - S_{t-m}) + (1-α)L_{t-1}
Seasonal: S_t = γ(Y_t - L_t) + (1-γ)S_{t-m}
Forecast: Ŷ_{t+h} = L_t + S_{t-m+h}
```

**Multiplicative Model:**
```
Level: L_t = α(Y_t / S_{t-m}) + (1-α)L_{t-1}
Seasonal: S_t = γ(Y_t / L_t) + (1-γ)S_{t-m}
Forecast: Ŷ_{t+h} = L_t × S_{t-m+h}
```

Where:
- α (alpha): Level smoothing parameter
- γ (gamma): Seasonal smoothing parameter
- m: Seasonal period (52 for weekly data)

### Part 1 Summary

**Winner:** Method 2 (Aggregate-Disaggregate)

### Key Insights

1. **Aggregation Benefits**: When department proportions are stable, aggregation reduces noise
2. **Granularity Trade-off**: Not all problems benefit from maximum granularity
3. **Context Matters**: Department characteristics determine optimal approach
