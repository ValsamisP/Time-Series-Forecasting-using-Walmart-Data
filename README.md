# Project Overview

This project is part of a Workshop Course of Master in Data Science at the University of Luxembourg and made by Panagiotis Valsamis and Costin-Andrei Taulescu, two aspiring Data Scientists.

## Goal

The goal of this project is to provide us experience on dealing, modelling, forecasting and solving real life complex time series problems, using Walmart data from a kaggle competition which took part before some year.

## Closer Look

During our project, there are two main tasks that we need to solve.

- Part 1: Compare aggregate-disaggregate method with direct forecasting method, this can be find either under the "quarto" folder in "Part1.qmd" either as a jupyter notebook named as "Part1_Comparing_HigherLevel_UnitLevel.ipynb"

- Part 2: To be done soon
