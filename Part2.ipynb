    "In the following part of the project, we will use one store from our data with aggregated sales information for all its deparments. The goal is to create a model that will be able to predict as much accurate as possible the sales on the horizon of two weeks. If we are able to predict with high accuracy then we will know the order that needs to be placed in order to satisfy the demand and the main goal is to maximize a rebate laid out in a contract between the store and its supplier."

    "\n",
    "We will use at least 6 months for testing, depending on the amount of data, ideally we would like to try 1 year of testing and see how the model performs. The forecast as we say will be for 2 weeks ahead and we will use a rolling forecast approach. The model will be retrained every time we have new data available. On our research, we will try to specify the months, that are more difficult to predict and see how well the model performs on those months. Since, we will select to proceed with the store \"1\", that we already make an analysis on the previous notebook, and we observed that there is no clear trend and there is clear seasonality, we will proceed with the same model as before. Depending on time constraints and results we might try to implement other models as well, that also implement trend to see what is the difference in performance. We will make as well a comparison between additive and multiplicative seasonality, as we did also in the previous notebook to check for differences in performance.\n",
